# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Overview
In this module we are using linear regression to predict the fuel efficiencies of several factors for prototype cars. 
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
We analyzed five components that could affect the overall miles per gallon (MPG) fuel efficiency of a car. The components are: vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance and whether the vehicle was all wheel drive or not. 
Using both linear regression and summary analysis we can see there is no statistical relevance with regard to the previously listed factors in determining fuel efficiency.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The statistical analysis for the suspension coils is as follows:

And the statistics for the Lot Summary:

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
The results for the t-tests are as follows:

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
In this section we examine the MechaCar versus competition. 
- One of the metrics to be tested in the spoiler angle.
- One way to do this is to set up a statistical analysis to see if a null value will determine any statistical relevance. If the null hypothesis is true, we ought to reject our hypothesis.
- One statistical test we could use is comparing p-values
- To use a p-value test, we must rejected if the p-value is below 0.05
