# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Overview
In this module we are using linear regression to predict the fuel efficiencies of several factors for prototype cars. 
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
We analyzed five components that could affect the overall miles per gallon (MPG) fuel efficiency of a car. The components are: vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance and whether the vehicle was all wheel drive or not.
